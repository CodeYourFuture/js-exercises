### For mentors

Levels 1-3 indicate difficulty. 

You can add a `your-topic.js` file under each level, with increasingly harder exercises.

For inspiration, you can look in some of the "practise" folders of previous weeks. Although prefered, it doesn't have to be a coding exercise - you can also just ask questions and expect a written answer.

Some suggestions for types of exercises (**though feel free to use your own!**):

> Given the following list/objects, create a function that prints X (and give expected output)

> Fix all the syntax errors in the following so that it prints the expected result correctly

> Answer the following questions:
> What data types (string/number/boolean/array/object) would you use to store the following information: some age, a name, details about a kitten, details about a litter of kittens?
