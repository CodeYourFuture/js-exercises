Many years into the future, a team of Space Voyagers find their ship is low on Oxygen and need to dock
somewhere safe while they call home for help.
  
  Their computer detects a list of nearby planets that have Oxygen in their atmosphere.

To be safe, they need to land on the first unamed planet that has Oxygen levels between 19.5 % and 23.5 %.

Find the oxygen level of the first safe planet - Oxygen between 19.5 and 23.5
