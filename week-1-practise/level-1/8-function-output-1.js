function getNumber() {
  return Math.random() * 10;
}

var result = getNumber();
console.log(result);

// Answer these questions:
// - What does this program do? It generats random numbers that are above 1 and below 10
// - How many parameters does the function take? No parameters in this exercise.
// - What is the function name? getNumber
// - Where is the function called? with what parameters? the function is assigned to the variable result (thus it is called at line 5) and it has an empty parameter.
