# Debugging My Book Library

My website should be able to:

- View a list of books that I've read
- Add books to a list of books that I've read
  - Including title, author, number of pages and if I've read it
  - If any of the information is missing it shouldn't add the book and should show an alert
- Remove books from my list

## Task

This purposefully broken website should use the tools we talked about in the lesson.
