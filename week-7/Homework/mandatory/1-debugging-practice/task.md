# My Book Library

My website should be able to:

- View a list of books that I've read
- Add books to a list of books that I've read
  - Including title, author, number of pages and if I've read it
  - If any of the information is missing it shouldn't add the book and should show an alert
- Remove books from my list

## Bugs to be fixed

1. Website loads but nothing works in my javascript 
2. Website loads but nothing happens (done)
3. Error in console when you try to add a book (done)
4. It uses the title name as the author name. (done)
5. Delete button is broken(done)
6. When I add a book that I say I've read - it saves the wrong answer(done)
7. All fields need to be filled(done)
8. if book read status 'no'..button color changes to red.(done)

I think there are other some other small bugs in my code...but I'm lazy so I can't fix them all.

I wish somebody would help me!
