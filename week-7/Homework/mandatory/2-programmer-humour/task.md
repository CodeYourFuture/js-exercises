# Programmer humor

Who knew programmers could be funny?

Write an function that makes an API call to `https://xkcd.com/info.0.json`

1. Create a `HTML`, `CSS` and `JavaScript` file to write your code in
   - You can use an example HTML like this here

- Inside the same file write a program that gets the `json` using Fetch.
- Each function should make an API call to the given endpoint: `https://xkcd.com/info.0.json`
- Log the received data to the console
- Render the `img` property into an `<img>` tag in the DOM
- Incorporate error handling
