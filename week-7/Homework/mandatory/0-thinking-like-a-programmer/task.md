## 2. Thinking like a Programmer

During these past weeks you have gotten a taste of what programming is: the various concepts, what it looks like in code and the way it's used. However, having written some code doesn't make you a programmer. Thinking like a programmer makes you into a programmer. But what does that mean, 'thinking like a programmer'?

Thinking like a programmer is very similar to thinking like a construction worker:

You have to build something and it's up to you to know all the necessary tools and techniques to make that happen, and
You have to solve every problem that comes up along the way (such as things that go wrong, knowing how to choose the right tools for the job and striving to achieve the right goal)
The second skill, problem solving, is the most important one. If you get good at that, you'll automatically get good at the first.

Take a look at the following resources to learn more about problem solving as applied to programming:
