# Tasks

## 1. Install ESLint

Using ESLint can make debugging a lot easier. If you haven't already you should install it now.

## 2. Thinking like a Programmer

During these past weeks you have gotten a taste of what programming is: the various concepts, what it looks like in code and the way it's used. However, having written some code doesn't make you a programmer. Thinking like a programmer makes you into a programmer. But what does that mean, 'thinking like a programmer'?

Thinking like a programmer is very similar to thinking like a construction worker:

You have to build something and it's up to you to know all the necessary tools and techniques to make that happen, and
You have to solve every problem that comes up along the way (such as things that go wrong, knowing how to choose the right tools for the job and striving to achieve the right goal)
The second skill, problem solving, is the most important one. If you get good at that, you'll automatically get good at the first.

Take a look at the following resources to learn more about problem solving as applied to programming:

After you've watched these videos I'd like you to answer these questions

## 1. What do you think the most important quality for a programmer is?

<!-- Understanding a problem
•	Draw diagram or user interface to be able to understand better.
•	Visualize what will you working on make is a lot easier to understand.
•	If you cannot visualise talk to a rubber docky or to your die- cast car to be able understand better.
-->

## 2. When trying to solve a challenge, what should you do first?

<!-- Once Understand the problem then you can break it into smaller pieces and try to solve them one time at a bit.
•	 Plan how are you going to break up your problem.
•	Allows you apply the libraries that you have in your tool box to move faster.
•	each task will be independent to create the bigger picture which is the final solution to our problem. -->

## 3. What should you do if you get stuck?

<!-- Getting Unstock on fix error/bugs
•	See the errors/bugs as challenges Not annoyances
•	Errors /bugs help you to learn more because helps you investigating on that Error/bug research.
•	Fixing the bug and understanding an error are to different thing.
•	Understand the error/bug go back to visualising the problem use diagram/rubber ducky
•	Break the problems into smaller problems.
•	Re evaluate make sure that you are targeting the problem correctly.
•	If None of step 3 works comment out your code and start over. -->
