# Tasks

## 1. Install ESLint

Using ESLint can make debugging a lot easier. If you haven't already you should install it now.

## 2. Thinking like a Programmer

During these past weeks you have gotten a taste of what programming is: the various concepts, what it looks like in code and the way it's used. However, having written some code doesn't make you a programmer. Thinking like a programmer makes you into a programmer. But what does that mean, 'thinking like a programmer'?

Thinking like a programmer is very similar to thinking like a construction worker:

You have to build something and it's up to you to know all the necessary tools and techniques to make that happen, and
You have to solve every problem that comes up along the way (such as things that go wrong, knowing how to choose the right tools for the job and striving to achieve the right goal)
The second skill, problem solving, is the most important one. If you get good at that, you'll automatically get good at the first.

Take a look at the following resources to learn more about problem solving as applied to programming:

After you've watched these videos I'd like you to answer these questions

## 1. What do you think the most important quality for a programmer is?

<!-- I think the most important quality for a programmer is to have problem-solving skills. A programmer should be able define the problems first. Then after clarifying the problems next step would be to define the solutions and taking steps. A programmer should be a good problem solver. We need to understand the problem first. We need to build a framework or structure before handling the problem so that we can visualize the problem. We can not do anything without understanding the problem entirely. Another useful technique is to speak out loud and trying to tell the problem ourselves. Like speaking to a rubber ducky, an imaginary friend listening to us.  -->

## 2. When trying to solve a challenge, what should you do first?

<!-- First we need to understand the challenge. Then we need a plan which includes steps we will be taking. Next step is to divide the big problem into smaller chunks so that we can handle each small problem at each time. Reducing the problem to something easier or simpler makes problem solving easier. These small problems is much manageable to solve than solving the whole big problem. If we can solve the simpler task we can go on with the complex one. We need to identify patterns and trends within problems as well. Then last of all we need to combine the dots.   -->

## 3. What should you do if you get stuck?

<!-- First one is debugging. We need to go step by step through our solution and trying to find what went wrong with the code. We need to see if the code is doing what I want.
Second one is Reassesing. This means we need to reconsider what is the problem. We can give a break and think again what we are being asked. Sometimes dealing with too much detail may cause tunnel viewing. We need to take a step back and look again.
Third one is research. We can make online research for our problem. But we should not look for big problem instead looking for small problems is better. We can search for answers even if we solved the problem. Because there are a lot we can learn from others. -->
