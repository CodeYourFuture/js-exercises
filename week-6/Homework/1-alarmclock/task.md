# Make an Alarm Clock

In this folder you will find the basic setup of an alarm clock.

You should only change code in the `alarmclock.js` file.

## How the clock should work

When you click the `Set Alarm` button the counter at the top of the screen should change to the number you entered in the `input` field. For example, if the `input` field says `10` then the title should say `Time Remaining: 00:10`.

Every one second the title should count down by one.

When the `Time Remaining` reaches `00:00` the alarm should play a sound. You can make the sound happen by using `playAlarm()`
