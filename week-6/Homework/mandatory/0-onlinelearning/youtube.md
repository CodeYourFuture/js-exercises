# Watch some online videos

There are some really amazing videos online that explain some of the harder topics that we learnt this week.

I'd like you to search online around these topics

- Asynchronous vs Synchronous
- What is a JavaScript callback?
- Client-Server Architecture

Here are some to get started:
