# Make a Quote Generator

In this folder you will find the basic setup of a quote generator.

You can change any of the files in this project.

## How the Quote Generator should work

When the page loads it should show a random quote from the `quotes` array on the screen. It should also show who said the quote.

When you click a button on the screen it should change the quote on the screen.

It can look however you like but there is an example in this folder at `quote_generator_example.png`.

## Need Help?

- If you can't work out how to find a random element from the array, either:
  - (advanced) try to use [`Math.random()`](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_random.asp)
  - OR
  - (basic) use the `pickFromArray()` function supplied in the `quotes.js` javascript file.

## Further work

See the `extra` folder of homework for further ideas for your Quote Generator.
