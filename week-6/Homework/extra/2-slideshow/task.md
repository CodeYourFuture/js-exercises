# Challenge: "Image Carousel"

## Challenge Overview

Make a website which allows the user to navigate a set of images (first manually, then with an auto-playing slideshow).

[Try this live demo!](https://cyf-image-carousel.netlify.app/)

# Level 1 Challenge

Make forward and back buttons to move _manually_ in that direction through a list of at least 4 images.

(e.g. When the user presses forward once, the display should move ONCE to the next image.)

You can use any images.

You can store the images within your app or you can use links to images hosted elsewhere ("hotlinking").

# Level 2 Challenge

Make auto-forward and auto-back buttons to _automatically_ move in that direction through the list of images.

Here's a screenshot example from a completed level 2 challenge.

## Try to finish the rest by yourself

If you want a harder challenge, don't read the rest of this document but instead try to build the app by yourself.

If you want hints, then you will find some below.

## Suggested approach

Here's one approach you might take to building this app.

### Task: Design your layout _on paper_

Design your layout on paper. Keep it very simple - this is a JavaScript challenge, not a CSS challenge.

Use a layout that will be ok on a phone (but _don't_ spend time on responsive design).

Keep this drawing around for reference later.

### Task: Convert your layout to HTML

Convert the drawing to HTML (on codepen or elsewhere) and check the buttons appear correctly.

_DON'T_ add any CSS or extra markup to make it look good just now. That will only make it more difficult for you to think about your app during development.

#### Task: Make the buttons work

Make your buttons work to navigate forwards and backwards, manually.

### Task: more buttons - automated slideshow

Add the following buttons:

- auto-forward
- stop
- auto-backwards

These should allow automatic navigation through the images, say every 5 seconds.

### End of basic challenge!

Congratulations, you've finished the basics!

- Make sure you can access it and play with it on a smartphone!
- Celebrate!
