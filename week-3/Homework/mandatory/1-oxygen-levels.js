/*
Many years into the future, a team of Space Voyagers find their ship is low on Oxygen and need to dock
somewhere safe while they call home for help.
  
Their computer detects a list of nearby planets that have Oxygen in their atmosphere.

To be safe, they need to land on the first unamed planet that has Oxygen levels between 19.5% and 23.5%.

Write a function that finds the oxygen level of the first safe planet - Oxygen between 19.5% and 23.5%

Some string methods that might help you here are .replace() and .substring(). Let's look at a quick
example before trying the exercise.
*/

/* .replace() allows us to add something where we removed something*/
let greeting = "Good Morning";
greeting.replace('Morning', 'Evening'); // outputs Good Evening


/* .substring() allows us to remove things from strings */
let dessert = "ice cream and pancakes";

let newdessert = dessert.substring(0, 9);

console.log(newdessert); // returns ice cream

/* + + + + + + + */
/* Now try the exercise */

function safeLevels() {

}
