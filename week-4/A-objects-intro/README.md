### Goals

- introduce objects as a concept
- when can we use objects (to store what type of information)
- the very specific object syntax (the commas after each property, the colon between property name and value, the curly brackets)
- good practices for naming giving names to properties (not having spaces, what to do when there is a space)
- the language to use when talking about an objects: object literal, properties, property names, property values
- very simple exercises to get them used to declaring object literals
