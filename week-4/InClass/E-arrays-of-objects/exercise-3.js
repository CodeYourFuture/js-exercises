/* 
Below are some restaurants in Glasgow. Each restaurant has a name, the number of total seats, 
the number of customers in the restaurant at the moment and the menu with prices.

We want to build an object to simulate a Restaurant Finder application (see below restaurantFinderApplication).

1) Define a method findAvailableRestaurants which takes a number of people in parameter and returns 
all the restaurant names which have the required number of seats available at the moment.

2) Define a method findRestaurantServingDish which takes a dish name in parameter and returns
all the restaurant names serving this dish.

3) Define a method countNumberOfRestaurantsInArea which takes an area of Glasgow in parameter (center, west),
and returns the number of restaurants in this area.
