/*

Choose a few nearby colleagues and one mentor, and go through each variable you 
declared above in Part 1 and 2, reading everything that happens out loud.

Make sure each member of your group has read at least one variable!
//Object Literal Syntax
//Object literals are defined using the following syntax rules:
//A colon separates property name[1] from value.
//A comma separates each name-value pair from the next.
//There should be no comma after the last name-value pair

Make sure you use words like:
- object literal // JavaScript object literal is a comma-separated list of name-value pairs wrapped in curly braces. Object literals encapsulate data, enclosing it in a tidy package. 
- property  // name:values pairs in JavaScript objects are called properties
- value = data type eg strings, numbers, booleans, [array of strings or array of numbers], 
- string / number / boolean
- declaring a variable
- etc.
