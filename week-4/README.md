Like learning a musical instrument, programming requires daily practise.

The exercises are split into two folders: `mandatory` and `extra`. All homework in the `mandatory` section **must** be completed for homework by the following Sunday. The `extra` folder contains exercises that you can complete to challenge yourself, but are not required for the following Sunday.

## Instructions for submission

1. Complete the challenges in each file and save it once you're happy with your changes
2. Run the script to check the results against the tests - all tests should read PASSED if you completed the challenges correctly. If a test reads FAILED, find the associated test to identify which function failed and fix it.
3. Raise a PR once you're happy with the quality of your code
