### More objects!

Object properties can even be assigned other objects or variables too. The example below shows an object with keys that have been assigned a variable, an array, and an object.

```js
var kittenName = "Feathers";

var kitten = {
  name: kittenName,
  toyCollection: ["blue ball", "green ball", "hoover box"],
  favoriteLocation: {
    roomName: "Living room",
    napPlace: "window",
    idealTemperatureCelsius: 24
  }
};
```
