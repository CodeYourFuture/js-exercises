/* Challenge 1: Famous Writers
Did you know you can also have an array of objects? We've created one for you here. Loop through the array, 
and for each object, `console.log()` out the sentence:
"Hi, my name is {firstName} {lastName}. I am {age} years old, and work as a {occupation}."
Here is the array:

let writers = [
    {
      firstName: "Virginia",
      lastName: "Woolf",
      occupation: "writer",
      age: 59,
      alive: false
    },
    {
      firstName: "Zadie",
      lastName: "Smith",
      occupation: "writer",
      age: 41,
      alive: true
    },
    {
      firstName: "Jane",
      lastName: "Austen",
      occupation: "writer",
      age: 41,
      alive: false
    },
    {
      firstName: "bell",
      lastName: "hooks",
      occupation: "writer",
      age: 64,
      alive: true
    }
  ];

  var writer = writers.map
  (obj => "Hi, my name is " +  obj.firstName + " " + obj.lastName + ". I am " + obj.age + " years old,and work as a " + obj.occupation

  );
  console.log(writer);

  var aliveWriters = writers.filter(obj => obj.alive == true).map(obj => obj.firstName);
  
  console.log(aliveWriters);
    

  /*
  If you want an extra challenge, only `console.log()` the writers that are alive.
