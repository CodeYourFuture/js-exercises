/*
Create an object that acts like a water bottle. 
It will need a volume key to store how full or empty the bottle is. 
It will be 100 when full and 0 when empty. 
Give your water bottle methods for filling it up, 
drinking some of it, and emptying it.

We made a start on this for you here: 
*/

let bottle = {
  volume: 0,
  fill: function() {
    // calling this function should make you bottles volume = 100;
    return (this.volume = 100);
  },
  drink: function() {
    // calling this function should decrease your bottles volume by 10;
    return (this.volume -= 10);
  },
  empty: function() {
    // this function should return true if your bottles volume = 0
    if (this.volume == 0) {
      return true;
    }
  }
};

/*
--TIP--

Remember that for changing properties on the current object inside one of its
methods you can refer to it by its variable name: `bottle`.

Once you have completed your object run the following and see if your answer 
matches the expected result at the bottom :)
*/

bottle.fill();
bottle.drink();
bottle.drink();
bottle.drink();
if (!bottle.empty()) {
  console.log(`bottles volume = ${bottle.volume}`);
}
console.log("Above volume should be: 70");
