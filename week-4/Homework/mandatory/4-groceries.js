/*
As you you can have an Array of Objects, you can also store Arrays in Objects.
In this exercise, you'll practice:
 - How to loop through the properties (keys) of an Object and read its values.
 - How to access Array stored inside Object.
 - How to access to a specific property of an array and set it.

You're going shopping, and you need a shopping list. You've already created your weekly meal plan
that contains the missing ingredients to your menus. It is stored in the "weeklyMealPlan" object.

Complete the exercises below.

Exercise 1:
  Loop through the weekly meal plan object to gather weakly ingredients into the weeklyGroceriesToBuy array.

Exercise 2:

Exercise 2:
  Loop through your weekly meal plan:
    - count how many ingredients you should buy per each day
