# Guidelines

## Week Mapping

This repository has an unusual numbering system compared to the weeks we teach

- JavaScript Core 1 Week 1 -> `Week 1`
- JavaScript Core 1 Week 2 -> `Week 2`
- JavaScript Core 1 Week 3 -> `Week 3`
- JavaScript Core 2 Week 1 -> `Week 4`
- JavaScript Core 2 Week 2 -> `Week 5`
- JavaScript Core 2 Week 3 -> `Week 6`
- JavaScript Core 3 Week 1 -> `Week 7`
- JavaScript Core 3 Week 2 -> `Week 8`
- JavaScript Core 3 Week 3 -> `Week 9`

TO DO - Move each of these into their own folder corresponding to their module number and rename to be more sensible. This must be done while students are not working on the repo to avoid conflicts.

## Reviewing students homework

1. Go to https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/js-exercises/pulls
2. Find the PR opened by the student you are designated to help
3. If your student has not opened a PR, ask them to open a PR following the instructions in the README
4. Assign yourself to your student's PR so that other mentors know that your student has a reviewer
5. Go to the files tab in the PR and start a review. The review should contain:

- Inline comments that:
  - Praise the student for showing initiative or creativity beyond the lesson
  - Point out mistakes or bad practises
  - Explain problems that could be caused by bad code
  - Ask why a solution might not work
  - Offer pointers or tips for a better solution
- An overall comment (when you click the review changes button) that:
  - Praises the student for their effort/progress
  - Let's them know if you've asked them to make changes
  - Highlights any themes that need particular attention, if necessary

6. Submit the review. As long as the student has attempted the homework, choose the option to accept changes so that they get a nice green tick (even if you are suggesting changes).
7. Add a label to the PR saying `reviewed`

Example PR review: https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/js-exercises/pull/23#pullrequestreview-100326735

Note: this review was written for a student who was advancing quickly so the comments and suggestions to learn additional language features are tailored accordingly.
