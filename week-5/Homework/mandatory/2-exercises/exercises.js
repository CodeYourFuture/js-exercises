    I'd like to display my three favorite books inside a nice webpage!

    const books = [
        {
            title: "The Design of Everyday Things",
            author: "Don Norman",
            alreadyRead: false

            author: "Andrew Hunt",
            alreadyRead: true
        }
    ];

    Iterate through the array of books.
    - For each book, create a <p> element with the book title and author and append it to the page.
    - Use a <ul> and <li> to display the books.
    - Add an <img> to each book that links to a URL of the book cover.
    - Change the style of the book depending on whether you have read it (green) or not (red).

    The end result should look something like this: https://hyf-js2-week1-makeme-ex1-demo.herokuapp.com/
