# String Calculator Kata
The following is a TDD Kata, an exercise in coding, refactoring and test-first, that you should apply daily for at least 15-30 minutes.

## Before you start
* Try not to read ahead.
* Do one task at a time. The trick is to learn to work incrementally.
* Make sure you only test for correct inputs. There is no need to test for invalid inputs for this kata.

## The kata

### Step 1: the simplest thing
Create a simple String calculator with a method ``int add(String numbers)``.

* The string argument can contain 0, 1 or 2 numbers, and will return their sum (for an empty string it will return 0) for example ``""`` or ``"1"`` or ``"1,2"``.
* Start with the simplest test case of an empty string and move to 1 and two numbers.
* Remember to solve things as simply as possible so that you force yourself to write tests you did not think about.
* Remember to refactor after each passing test.

### Step 2: handle an unknown amount of numbers
Allow the ``add()`` method to handle an unknown amount of numbers.

### Step 3: handle new lines between numbers
Allow the ``add()`` method to handle new lines between numbers (instead of commas).

* the following input is ok:  ``"1\n2,3"`` (will equal 6)
* the following input is NOT ok:  ``"1,\n"`` (not need to prove it - just clarifying)

### Step 4: support different delimiters
Support different delimiters: to change a delimiter, the beginning of the string will contain a separate line that looks like this:   

``"//[delimiter]\n[numbers...]"``

For example ``"//;\n1;2"`` should return 3 where the default delimiter is ``';'``.

The first line is optional. 
All existing scenarios should still be supported.

### Step 5: negative numbers
Calling ``add()`` with a negative number will throw an exception ``"negatives not allowed"`` - and the negative that was passed.

For example ``add("1,4,-1")`` should throw an exception with the message ``"negatives not allowed: -1"``.

If there are multiple negatives, show all of them in the exception message.

### Step 6: ignore big numbers
Numbers bigger than 1000 should be ignored, so adding 2 + 1001  = 2

## General requirements
- Use whatever language and frameworks you want. Use something that you know well.
- Provide a README with instructions on how to compile and run the application.

**IMPORTANT:**  Implement the requirements focusing on **writing the best code** you can produce.

**CODE SUBMISSION:** Add the code to your own Github account and send us the link.
