There are some tools that will help you to write code. One of these, [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), formats your code, making it easier for you and others to read.

### 1. Install prettier

* In Visual Studio open the extensions panel (see https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery#_browse-and-install-extensions)
* Search for `Prettier - Code formatter`
* Click install on the top result

### 2. Enable formatting on save

* In Visual Studio open the settings file (see https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings#_creating-user-and-workspace-settings)
* Search for `editor format`
* Set `editor.formatOnSave` and `editor.formatOnPaste` to true
