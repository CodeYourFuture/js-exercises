The input given to a function is called a **parameter**.

A function can take more than one parameter:

```js
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

When you write a function (sometimes called _declaring a function_) you assign names to the parameters inside of the parentheses (`()`). Parameters can be called anything.

This function is exactly the same as the on above:

```js
function add(num1, num2) {
  return num1 + num2;
}
```
