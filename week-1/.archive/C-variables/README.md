When you write code, you'll want to create shortcuts to data values so you can don't have to write out the same value every time.

We can use _variable_ to create a reference to a value.

```js
var greeting = "Hello world";

console.log(greeting);
```

The program above will print "Hello world" to the console. Notice how it uses the value assigned to the variable `greeting`.

## Exercise

* Add a variable `greeting` to exercise.js (make sure it comes _before_ the console.log)
* Print your `greeting` to the console 3 times

> Remember: to run this exercise you must change directory to the `D-variables`. If you already have a terminal window open for the previous exercise you can do this by running the command `cd ../D-variables`.

## Expected result

```
Hello world
Hello world
Hello world
```
