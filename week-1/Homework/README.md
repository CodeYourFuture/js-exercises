# Homework

Like learning a musical instrument, programming requires daily practise.

The exercises are split into two folders: `mandatory` and `extra`. All homework in the `mandatory` section **must** be completed for homework by the following Sunday. The `extra` folder contains exercises that you can complete to challenge yourself, but are not required for the following Sunday.

## Instructions for submission

For your homework, we'll be using **test driven development** to check your answers. Test driven development (or TDD) is the practice of writing tests for your code first, and then write your code to pass those tests. This is a very useful way of writing good quality code and is used in a lot of industries. You don't have to worry about knowing how this works, but if you're curious, engage with a volunteer to find out more! :)

1. Complete the challenges in each file and save it once you're happy with your changes
2. Run the script to check the results against the tests - all tests should read PASSED if you completed the challenges correctly. If a test reads FAILED, find the associated test to identify which function failed and fix it.
3. Raise a PR once you're happy with the quality of your code.
