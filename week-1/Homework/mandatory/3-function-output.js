/* The Math.random() function returns a floating-point, pseudo-random number in the range 0 to less than 1 (inclusive of 0, but not 1) with approximately uniform distribution over that range â€” which you can then scale to your desired range.
 The implementation selects the initial seed to the random number generation algorithm; it cannot be chosen or reset by the user.
 * 10 that means random number between 0-10.
 for Getting a random integer between two values, we can use min and max values  The value is no lower than min (or the next integer greater than min if min isn't an integer), and is less than (but not equal to) max.
