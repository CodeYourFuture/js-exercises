/**

Let's peer into the future using a Magic 8 Ball!
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8-Ball 

There are a few steps to being able view the future though:
* Ask a question
* Shake the ball
* Get an answer
* Decide if it's positive or negative

The question can be anything, but the answers are fixed,
and have different levels of positivity or negativity.

Below are the possible answers:

##Â Very positive
It is certain.
It is decidedly so.
Without a doubt.
Yes - definitely.
You may rely on it.

## Positive
As I see it, yes.
Most likely.
Outlook good.
Yes.
Signs point to yes.

## Negative
Reply hazy, try again.
Ask again later.
Better not tell you now.
Cannot predict now.
Concentrate and ask again.

## Very negative
Don't count on it.
My reply is no.
My sources say no.
Outlook not so good.
Very doubtful.
