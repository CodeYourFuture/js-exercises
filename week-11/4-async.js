/* EXERCISE 4 - Async
 * Before beginning this exercise, please run `npm install node-fetch` in any directory in your folder.
 * This ensures that the node-fetch package is installed and allows you to use `fetch` with Node JS.
 *
 * Below is an implementation of 3 functions - getPosts(), printBody(..) and toString(..)
 *
 * 4.a
 * getPosts() is a partially implemented async function. To see the format of the fetch response, go to the request URL.
 * 
 * Refactor this function so that
 *  - The function is asynchronous
 *  - It resolves the output of the fetch request to https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
 *  - It returns a JSON object of the response
 *
 * Hint: there is one extra `await` and `async` keyword missing 
 *
 * 4.b
 * Call the functions so that the order of operations are as follows:
 *  - First call the getPosts() function
 *  - Then run printBody(..) on the output of getPosts()
 *  - Then run toString(..) on the output of printBody(..)
 *  
 *  Bonus points for using arrow functionsn correctly in the .then(..) method
 *
 * 4.c
 * Can you explain what line 42 does?
 *
 * Hint: you are encouraged to use Google or have a discussion on Slack to find out what .slice(0,3) does
 *
 * 4.d
 * Can you reformat toString(..) to be an arrow function?
 *
 * 4.c
 * Can you appropriately comment each function to explain what each does?
