# JavaScript exercises

1. Fork this repo
2. Clone it to your machine
3. open it in your code editor.
4. In the terminal, run this command to add CodeYourFuture as an `upstream` remote.
`git remote add upstream git@github.com:CodeYourFuture/js-exercises.git` 
5. run the command `git remote -v` and you should have two remote: `origin` pointing to your github repo, and `upstream` point to CodeYourFuture. (why do we add `upstream`?)


During the class (and for homework), we will go through each folder, reading the README and completing the exercises.

For **Homework**, we expect you to `push` to your repo and create a `Pull Request` for us to review your code.
