# Dog photo gallery

Let's make a randomized dog photo gallery!

Write a function that makes an API call to `https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random`. It should trigger after clicking a button in your webpage. Every time the button is clicked it should append a new dog image to the DOM.

- Create an `index.html` file that will display your random image
- Add `<button>` and `<ul>` element, either in the HTML or through JavaScript
- When the button is clicked it should make an API call to `https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random`
- After receiving the data, append to the `<ul>` a `<li>` that contains an `<img>` element with the dog image
- Incorporate error handling
