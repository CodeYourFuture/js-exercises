# Code reading

## Question 1

Take a look at the following code:

```
1    let x = 1;
2    {
3        let x = 2;
4        console.log(x);
5    }
6    console.log(x);
```

Explain why line 4 and line 6 output different numbers.

In line 4 we are logging the value of the variable x declared on line 3 which is local to the code block between lines 2 and 5. However, on line 6 we are logging the value of global variable x which is declared on line 1.

## Question 2

Take a look at the following code:

```
let x = 10

function f1()
{
    console.log(x)
    let y = 20
}

console.log(f1())
console.log(y)
```

What will be the output of this code. Explain your answer in 50 words or less.

Variable x is global, therefore it could be accessed by the f1() function so we can log it from within the function:
The first console.log will show the value of x i.e. 10.
The second console.log will show y is not defined as we declared it inside the function and it could not be accessed globally.

## Question 3

Take a look at the following code:

```
const x = 9;

function f1(val) {
  val = val + 1;
  return val;
}

f1(x);
console.log(x);

const y = { x: 9 };

function f2(val) {
  val.x = val.x + 1;
  return val;
}

f2(y);
console.log(y);
```

What will be the output of this code. Explain your answer in 50 words or less.
