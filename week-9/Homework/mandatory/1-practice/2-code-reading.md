# Code reading

## Question 1

Take a look at the following code:

```
1    let x = 1;
2    {
3        let x = 2;
4        console.log(x);
5    }
6    console.log(x);
```

Explain why line 4 and line 6 output different numbers.

line 6 log first variable, the first variable is global variable and can be use evrywhere in code,
but om line 4 the second variable been logged which is local variable.
means it's just been defined inside the square bracets.

## Question 2

Take a look at the following code:

```
let x = 10

function f1()
{
    console.log(x)
    let y = 20
}

console.log(f1())
console.log(y)
```

What will be the output of this code. Explain your answer in 50 words or less.

the first log's output is 10, it's been defined globally and used inside the function.
the second log's output is not defined because it tries to log a local variable outside the function.

## Question 3

Take a look at the following code:

```
const x = 9;

function f1(val) {
  val = val + 1;
  return val;
}

f1(x);
console.log(x);

const y = { x: 9 };

function f2(val) {
  val.x = val.x + 1;
  return val;
}

f2(y);
console.log(y);
```

What will be the output of this code. Explain your answer in 50 words or less.
first console.log output is 9,
second console.log is an object: x: 9
