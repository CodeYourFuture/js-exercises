 * First, let's create a function that creates a list of all the frequencies.
 * Call this function `getAllFrequencies`.
 *
 * This function should:
 * - Create an array  starting at 87 and ending in 108
 * - Should return this array to use in other functions
 */

/**
 * Next, let's write a function that gives us only the frequencies that are radio stations.
 * Call this function `getStations`.
 *
 * This function should:
 * - Get the available frequencies from `getAllFrequencies`
 * - There is a helper function called isRadioFrequency that takes an integer as an argument and returns a boolean.
 * - Sort the stations by low - high e.g. 1,2,3,4,5
 * - Return only the frequencies that are radio stations.
 */

/**
 * Lastly, let's make a function for people to use.
 * When this runs, it should use the above two functions to log to the `console`
 * Call this function `searchRadioWaves`.
 * - "ðŸŽ¶ station found at ${frequency}, enjoy!"
 * - "No station found at ${frequency}, moving on"
