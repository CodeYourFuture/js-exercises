We can also write **expressions** that return boolean values.

Here's an expression that evaulates to a boolean.

```
1 > 2
```

* Can you work out what value this expression evaluates to?

The `>` symbol in the expression is a **comparison operator**. Comparison operators compare two values. This operator checks to see if the number on the left is bigger than the number on the right.

`1` is not bigger than `2` so this expression returns `false`.

**More comparison operators**

```
>   greater than
<   less than
<=  less than or equal
>=  greater than or equal
=== same value
!== not the same value
```

## Exercise

* Open `exercise.js` and follow the instructions.
* Open a node console, and write some expressions that use comparison operators
