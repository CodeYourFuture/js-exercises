  Can you change so that it counts down from 10 to 1?

Exercise 2-b:
---------------------------------

   Great work! :) Now create a for loop the prints "drinking a glass of water" 4 times to the console.

   Use the glass variable inside the for loop. 
   If the value of glass is smaller than 4, then print "drinking a glass of water"

    - HINT: check the for loop cake example in the week-2 presentation

  let glass = 0;

  // add your code here, starting with: for(...) {...}
